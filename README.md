# Red-Scare
Code repo for ITU algorithm design, concerning the "Red Scare" project. 

The project code runs through the **main.ipynb** notebook. 
All import requirements are in the **requirements.txt** file.

#### Results are stored in **notebooks/results.txt**
The **notebooks/500.txt** file contains results of all graphs with at least 500 vertices, like the one displayed in the example report. (we were not sure whether had to include it in the report itself, so we made it as its own separate file)
